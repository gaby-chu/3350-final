Numerous men committed suicide rather than face bankruptcy. In response, the U.S. Government imposed stringent rules on the buying and selling of stocks. These make it less likely that a similar catastrophic devaluation could occur now.

Hydrogen had two big advantages over helium. It had greater lifting potential and was much cheaper. Unfortunately, it is one of the most flammable substances in the world. Helium could be used to put fires out. Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen. This luxurious craft had just come from Europe, making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean much faster than any ship. It was the pride of Nazi Germany. It s loss was a blow to the morale of the German engineers. The German public never heard much about it. The exact cause of the fire and crash has never been determined.)""Now, with the help and support of the woman I love."" - KING EDWARD VIII (of England)(Speech on 12/11/36, after he had announced that he was abdicating the throne of England to marry Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson Spencer, an American socialite)""Urging the people to evacuate the city as Martians approach.""""Never to go to war with one another again"""". . .Juden. . .""ADOLPH HITLER (speaking in German, referring to the Jews)""This country is at war with Germany.""PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON (address to Congress 4/2/17, bringing the United States into World War I)""December 7, 1941, (the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor) a date which will live in infamy.""FRANKLIN D.

President Kennedy died at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time"" - WALTER CRONKITE(confirming the assassination in Dallas, Texas on 11/22/63)""Lee Harvey Oswald was shot.""(His death at the hands of Jack Ruby prevented any clear resolution of this crime. Numerous conspiracy theories have evolved because of this lack of information. When you see notorious criminals going to and from jail, with armed guards, wearing body armor themselves, this is where it started. As much as many would like to see these animals die, protecting them until the judicial process is completed is common practice.)""I have a dream (Really?) that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."" - MARTIN LUTHER KING(At the Civil Rights March of March 20, 1967 in Washington D.C.)""And I say segregation now"" - GEORGE WALLACE(Governor of Alabama 1963-1967)""What we have foremost in common is their enemy."" - MALCOLM X(In the early 1960 s a ""Black militant"" who believed in complete separation of the races)""segregation tomorrow"" - GEORGE WALLACE""the white man"" - MALCOLM XAnd segregation forever"" - GEORGE WALLACEHe s an enemy to all of us."" - MALCOLM X""I have a dream"" - MARTIN LUTHER KING""I am about to sign into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964."" - PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON(He became President following the assassination of President John Kennedy. Civil rights was a major goal for Kennedy, but he would not likely have had the same success that Johnson did. Johnson was able to pass this legislation becuase he was from the South (Texas). He had been Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate and knew how to get things through Congress. In addition, he apparently would do whatever was necessary to get what he wanted.)""The Beatles!"" ""And today I ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division. Additional forces will be needed later and they will be sent."" - PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON""I have very sad news for all of you. Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis Tennessee.""March 20, 1967""Senator Kennedy has been shot. Is that possible?""(June 10, 1967, just after he had won the California Primary Election, and was then moving strongly toward the Democratic nomination.)""As he said many times in many parts of this nation, Some men see things as they are and say, Why? I dream things that never were and say, Why not? "" - SENATOR TED KENNEDY(younger brother of Robert, at his funeral. He was paraphrasing George Bernard Shaw. In ""Back to Methuselah"" he wrote You see things; and you say ""Why?"" But I dream things that never were; and I say, ""Why not?"" )""That s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" - ASTRONAUT NEIL ARMSTRONG(as he became the first man to set foot on the moon. This was a goal that President Kennedy had declared. The saying was mis-stated, however. It should have been ""That s one small step for me, one giant leap for mankind"")""It s a free concert from now on.""(Comment from one of the promoters. It had become clear that the total chaos prevented any ticket selling or collecting at the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. This was held 8/15-8/17/69 in rural New York State.)""We must be in Heaven, man"" - Cheech and Chong""Four persons including two women were shot and killed in Ohio today.

That ball is gonna be, out of here. It s gone. It s 715. There s a new home run champion of all time and it s Henry Aaron.""(There was substantial sentiment against Aaron because he was Black. Death threats were made and were taken seriously. After the home run his mother ran onto the field and hugged her son. She later said that one of the reasons she did this was to shield him from a possible assassin.)""Well, I m not a crook"" - PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON""Here s Johnny"" - ED MCMAHON(announcer of the Tonight Show, introducing Johnny Carson)""I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow."" - PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON(As the Senate was clearly ready to impeach him due to the Watergate scandal.)""An absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon."" - PRESIDENT GERALD FORD""My name is Jimmy Carter, and I m running for President."" - GEORGIA GOVERNOR JIMMY CARTER""Live from New York, it s Saturday Night.""""Elvis Presley died today at Baptist Hospital in Memphis.""(Of heart failure, drug overdose on 8/16/77)""John Lennon was brought to the Emergency Room.

For the young, inexperienced, not-to-bright Quayle to refer to the revered former President so casually as ""Jack"" was not appropriate. Comparing himself to Kennedy was beyond laughable.)""Mr. Gorbachov, tear down this wall."" - PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN(to Soviet Prime Minister Michael Gorbachov, referring to the Berlin Wall. This had been erected to separate the Russian and Allied sectors of the city. It kept the West out, but it s primary purpose was to keep East Germans from escaping.)""I don t think it was wrong."" - OLIVER NORTH(Regarding the trading of weapons for hostages, in what came to be known as the Iran-contra affair.)""We did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages."" - PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN""I think it was a neat idea."" - OLIVER NORTH""Everyone on Sesame Street is always talking about love.

The flight took thirty three and a half hours. Of course, he had to be awake the entire time, and alert enough to pilot a plane.)""Today, paniced investors ordered their brokers to sell at whatever the price in the stock market crashed.""(In October, 1929, an over-valued stock market, with many owning shares purchased ""on margin"" or with borrowed money, crashed. Numerous men committed suicide rather than face bankruptcy. In response, the U.S. Government imposed stringent rules on the buying and selling of stocks. These make it less likely that a similar catastrophic devaluation could occur now. The insurance companies began to exclude suicide as an acceptable cause of death for life insurance policies and/or wrote in a two year waiting period before benefits could be paid.)""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" - PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT(From his first Inaugural Address, 3/4/33. In the depths of the Great Depression, the pessimism of the population and especially the business community kept things bad. Decisions based on a gloomy outlook caused things to get even worse. In that respect, the mood and expectation of bad times became a self-fulfilling prophecy.)""Horrific place, ladies and gentlemen, the smoke and the flames now, ooh, the humanity""(Live radio account of the fire and crash of the German airship ""Hindenburg."" It happened 5/6/37 on the eve of the Second World War in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Hindenburg was the largest airship ever built. It was filled with an enormous quantity of hydrogen. Hydrogen had two big advantages over helium. It had greater lifting potential and was much cheaper. Unfortunately, it is one of the most flammable substances in the world. Helium could be used to put fires out. Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen. This luxurious craft had just come from Europe, making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean much faster than any ship. It was the pride of Nazi Germany. It s loss was a blow to the morale of the German engineers. The German public never heard much about it. The exact cause of the fire and crash has never been determined.)""Now, with the help and support of the woman I love."" - KING EDWARD VIII (of England)(Speech on 12/11/36, after he had announced that he was abdicating the throne of England to marry Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson Spencer, an American socialite)""Urging the people to evacuate the city as Martians approach.""""Never to go to war with one another again"""". . .Juden. . .""ADOLPH HITLER (speaking in German, referring to the Jews)""This country is at war with Germany.""PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON (address to Congress 4/2/17, bringing the United States into World War I)""December 7, 1941, (the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor) a date which will live in infamy.""FRANKLIN D.

He had been accused of improperly taking gifts. One of the gifts was a small dog.)""Are you a member of the Communist Party?"" - SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY(In 1950-51 he held hearings in Congress in which he accused first and investigated later.

Numerous conspiracy theories have evolved because of this lack of information. When you see notorious criminals going to and from jail, with armed guards, wearing body armor themselves, this is where it started.

Civil rights was a major goal for Kennedy, but he would not likely have had the same success that Johnson did. Johnson was able to pass this legislation becuase he was from the South (Texas). He had been Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate and knew how to get things through Congress. In addition, he apparently would do whatever was necessary to get what he wanted.)""The Beatles!"" ""And today I ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division. Additional forces will be needed later and they will be sent."" - PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON""I have very sad news for all of you.

That ball is gonna be, out of here. It s gone. It s 715. There s a new home run champion of all time and it s Henry Aaron.""(There was substantial sentiment against Aaron because he was Black. Death threats were made and were taken seriously. After the home run his mother ran onto the field and hugged her son. She later said that one of the reasons she did this was to shield him from a possible assassin.)""Well, I m not a crook"" - PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON""Here s Johnny"" - ED MCMAHON(announcer of the Tonight Show, introducing Johnny Carson)""I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow."" - PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON(As the Senate was clearly ready to impeach him due to the Watergate scandal.)""An absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon."" - PRESIDENT GERALD FORD""My name is Jimmy Carter, and I m running for President."" - GEORGIA GOVERNOR JIMMY CARTER""Live from New York, it s Saturday Night.""""Elvis Presley died today at Baptist Hospital in Memphis.""(Of heart failure, drug overdose on 8/16/77)""John Lennon was brought to the Emergency Room.

For the young, inexperienced, not-to-bright Quayle to refer to the revered former President so casually as ""Jack"" was not appropriate. Comparing himself to Kennedy was beyond laughable.)""Mr. Gorbachov, tear down this wall."" - PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN(to Soviet Prime Minister Michael Gorbachov, referring to the Berlin Wall. This had been erected to separate the Russian and Allied sectors of the city. It kept the West out, but it s primary purpose was to keep East Germans from escaping.)""I don t think it was wrong."" - OLIVER NORTH(Regarding the trading of weapons for hostages, in what came to be known as the Iran-contra affair.)""We did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages."" - PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN""I think it was a neat idea."" - OLIVER NORTH""Everyone on Sesame Street is always talking about love.
