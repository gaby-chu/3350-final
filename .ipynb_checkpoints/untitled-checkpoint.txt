Final Project: Responsibility statement


We met in person to work on the project together, rather than splitting the tasks up individually and working on it separately. The link to our GitHub is above to see the commits for each person, but we ended up just using the same computer most of the time to figure out code and descriptions at the same time. While we mainly did these tasks together, the following is a general distribution of who took the lead on each part.

Estelle's tasks:
- Introduction and Hypothesis
- Corpus creation (webscraping)
- Word counts matrix
- Results sections
- edit Gaby's writing

Gaby's tasks:
- Topic modeling
- Word embedding
- Results section
- Discussion and Conclusions
- edit Estelle's writing
